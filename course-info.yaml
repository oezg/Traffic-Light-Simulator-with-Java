title: Traffic Light Simulator with Java
language: English
summary: "<p>Do you know how traffic lights were invented? Some time ago, it was decided\
  \ to replace the traffic police officers with a looped automated system that gives\
  \ information to drivers about whether they can continue driving or not. In this\
  \ project, we will implement a simplified version of such a system for a road junction\
  \ in which many roads converge to one.<strong> </strong>You will practice concepts\
  \ frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</p>"
